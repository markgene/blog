# Guideline

* Notes to books and courses are archived in Bookdown projects, each one in a separate project.

* Notes to a subject such as cancer biology and data science is archived in Bookdown projects too. It should have a glossary chapter and is divided into parts if needed.

* In terms of technical issues particularly in data science, computer science, software programming, they are usually in the form of bits and bites. I archive them in one single Blogdown project. They provide the materials for notes to a subject.

# Data science

* For a topic in data science, such as linear regression or regression diagnostics, divide it into three or more sections: theory, R implementation, Python implementation, or implementation in other languages or ecosystem such as Spark.

* For packages or libraries, archive personal notes by language and package, one folder one package. For example, `lm` package in R will be a directory of `R/lm`; `numpy` of Python will be `Python/numpy`. The notes should be in the most popular and/or convenient format. For example, R will be Rmarkdown; Python will be Jupyter book or `rst` format. Markdown format could be a choice of general purpose. Meanwhile, archive simple notes and comments in Blogdown objects.
